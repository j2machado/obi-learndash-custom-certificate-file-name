# Obi LearnDash Custom Certificate Filename

With this plugin you can set a custom name string for your LearnDash Certificates.

When a user downloads an earned certificate, it comes with a specific name structure by default.

You can set this name structure with whatever you want, e.g., A custom acronym, the course completion date, the user's first name, course name, certificate ID, which would translate to something like: ABC-12052023-Steve-Your Awesome Course-123.pdf.
